# Fuzzy-String-Matching-Using-FuzzyWuzzy-Library

Fuzzy string matching like a boss. It uses <b>Levenshtein Distance</b> to calculate the differences between sequences. 

Python-Levenshtein provides a 4-10x speedup in String Matching. The <b>Levenshtein distance</b> is a string metric for measuring the difference between two sequences. Informally, the Levenshtein distance between two words is the minimum number of single-character edits (insertions, deletions or substitutions) required to change one word into the other. It is named after the Soviet mathematician Vladimir Levenshtein, who considered this distance in 1965.

- You can use this library by installing
<b>pip install fuzzywuzzy</b>

- You can also install python-Levenshtein library to speed up the process
<b>pip install fuzzywuzzy[speedup]</b>
